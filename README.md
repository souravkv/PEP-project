# Sudoku Solver GUI

This Java application offers an intuitive Sudoku solving experience with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Swing. Users can input puzzles, initiate the solving process, and visualize the step-by-step solution. The powerful backtracking algorithm ensures quick solutions to challenging puzzles.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The primary component is a 9x9 grid of text fields representing the Sudoku puzzle. Users can input numbers directly or load puzzles from external files. The GUI features buttons for loading puzzles, starting the solving process, and controlling the animation speed.

## Puzzle Input and Display

Users can type numbers into the text fields or load puzzles from various file formats. The grid highlights the 3x3 subgrids for clarity, making it easier to input and modify values correctly.

## Solving Algorithm

The backtracking algorithm systematically tries different values for each empty cell, ensuring no violations of Sudoku rules. If a candidate value is invalid, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different value, continuing until a solution is found or all combinations are exhausted.

## Solving Animation

The application provides an animation of the solving process, highlighting the current cell and its candidate values. Users can adjust the animation speed to control the pace of the solution process, making it interactive and engaging.

## Puzzle Loading and Saving

Users can load puzzles from external files and save solved or in-progress puzzles. This allows users to revisit puzzles later or share them, keeping track of their progress and continuing at a later time.

## Customization Options

The application offers customization options for personalizing the user experience. Users can adjust grid size, font, color themes, and animation speed, enhancing visual appeal and comfort.

## Conclusion and Future Improvements

The Sudoku Solver GUI provides a comprehensive and engaging way to solve Sudoku puzzles. Future improvements could include support for different difficulty levels, additional solving algorithms, puzzle generation capabilities, conflict highlighting, and step-by-step visualization of the solving process. These enhancements would make the application even more versatile and informative.
